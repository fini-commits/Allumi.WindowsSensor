# 🎯 Ready to Test - Message for Lovable

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All sides aligned and ready for end-to-end testing

---

## ✅ Windows App - READY

**Latest Build:** Release build completed successfully  
**Latest Commit:** `74e4eb2` - "Update status: All sides aligned, ready for end-to-end testing"

### What's Implemented:

1. **Setup Token Handler** (`Program.cs`)
   - Catches `allumi://setup?token=xxx` URLs
   - Extracts token from query parameter
   - Saves to `.exchange-token` file
   - Shows MessageBox: "Device setup initiated!"
   - Launches app normally

2. **Token Exchange** (`Config.cs`)
   - Reads token from `.exchange-token` file
   - HTTP POST to `/functions/v1/exchange-device-token`
   - Receives credentials: `{ deviceId, apiKey, syncUrl, userId }`
   - Saves to `config.json`
   - Deletes token file (single-use)
   - Falls back to OAuth if exchange fails

3. **Protocol Registration**
   - `allumi://` registered in Windows Registry
   - Automatic during installation

---

## ✅ Backend (Lovable) - CONFIRMED READY

Based on your update, you have:

1. **Token Generation** - `generate-custom-installer` edge function
   - Creates device record
   - Generates API key
   - Creates exchange token (5-minute expiry)
   - Returns: `{ installerUrl, exchangeToken, deviceId, deviceName }`

2. **Exchange Endpoint** - `/functions/v1/exchange-device-token`
   - Validates token (not expired, not consumed)
   - Marks token as consumed
   - Returns credentials

3. **Database Table** - `device_exchange_tokens`
   - Stores tokens with expiry
   - Tracks consumption

---

## ✅ Frontend (Lovable) - JUST COMPLETED

You said: *"Updated installer service to handle the JSON response - it now downloads the installer from GitHub and returns the exchange token for the custom URL scheme approach (allumi://setup?token=...)"*

**What we need to confirm works:**

1. User clicks "Download Windows Tracker"
2. Frontend calls `generate-custom-installer`
3. Frontend receives: `{ installerUrl, exchangeToken }`
4. Installer downloads from GitHub
5. User installs app
6. **Critical:** Frontend opens: `window.location.href = 'allumi://setup?token=${exchangeToken}'`
7. Windows app catches the URL and processes token

---

## 🧪 Test Plan

### Test 1: Happy Path (5-10 minutes)

**Expected Flow:**

```
1. Login to Allumi dashboard
   ↓
2. Click "Download Windows Tracker"
   ↓ Frontend calls generate-custom-installer
3. Receive: { installerUrl, exchangeToken }
   ↓ Browser console should show token
4. Download installer (normal Squirrel installer)
   ↓
5. Run installer → Complete installation
   ↓
6. Frontend shows dialog: "Click OK after installing"
   ↓
7. User clicks OK
   ↓ Frontend executes: window.location.href = 'allumi://setup?token=tok_xxx'
8. Windows app launches
   ↓ Shows: "Device setup initiated!"
9. App exchanges token for credentials
   ↓ Creates config.json
10. App starts tracking
   ↓
11. Activities appear in dashboard (within 60 seconds)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Zero manual configuration
- ✅ Token exchanged successfully
- ✅ Activities sync to dashboard
- ✅ Database shows `consumed = true` for token

## 🔍 Validation Points

### Frontend (Browser Console)
```javascript
// After clicking "Download Windows Tracker"
// Should see:
{
  "installerUrl": "https://github.com/fini-commits/Allumi.WindowsSensor/releases/latest/download/AllumiWindowsSensor-Setup.exe",
  "exchangeToken": "tok_abc123xyz",
  "deviceId": "windows-uuid-timestamp",
  "deviceName": "User's Windows PC"
}
```

### Windows App (PowerShell)
```powershell
# After installation, check config was created:
Get-Content "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\AllumiWindowsSensor\app-*\config.json"

# Should show:
# {
#   "deviceId": "windows-uuid-timestamp",
#   "apiKey": "alm_xxx",
#   "syncUrl": "https://...supabase.co/functions/v1/sync-device-activity",
#   "userId": "user-uuid",
#   "idleThresholdSeconds": 60
# }

# Check logs for success:
Get-Content "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\AllumiWindowsSensor\app-*\logs\sensor.log" -Tail 10
Get-Content "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\AllumiWindowsSensor\app-*\logs\sync.log" -Tail 10

# Verify token was deleted (should return False):
Test-Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\AllumiWindowsSensor\app-*\.exchange-token"
```

### Database (Supabase)
```sql
-- Check token was consumed
SELECT token, consumed, consumed_at, expires_at 
FROM device_exchange_tokens 
WHERE token = 'tok_xxx';
-- Should show: consumed = true

-- Verify activities are syncing
SELECT * FROM activities 
WHERE device_id = 'windows-xxx'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 10;
-- Should show recent activities
```

## 🐛 If Something Fails

### Issue: "Protocol not supported" when opening `allumi://`

**Cause:** App not installed or protocol not registered

**Fix:** 
- Verify installer completed successfully
- Check Registry: `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\allumi` should exist
- Reinstall if necessary

---

### Issue: Token exchange returns 401

**Cause:** Token expired (>5 minutes old) or already consumed

**Fix:**
- Check token age
- Generate new token (re-download)
- Use OAuth fallback

---

### Issue: App starts but doesn't track

**Cause:** Config not created or network error during exchange

**Fix:**
- Check if `config.json` exists in app directory
- Check logs in `[AppDir]\logs\sensor.log`
- Verify exchange endpoint is reachable
- Restart app to retry

## 📊 What We're Testing

| Component | What to Verify |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Token Generation** | Backend creates token with 5-min expiry |
| **Token Delivery** | Frontend opens `allumi://setup?token=xxx` |
| **Token Reception** | Windows app catches URL, saves token |
| **Token Exchange** | App exchanges token for credentials |
| **Token Consumption** | Database marks `consumed = true` |
| **Config Creation** | `config.json` created automatically |
| **Activity Tracking** | Activities sync to dashboard |

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

**Best Case (95% probability):**
- ✅ Token exchange succeeds
- ✅ Zero manual configuration
- ✅ Activities appear within 60 seconds
- ✅ User sees nothing except "Download → Install → Done"

**Fallback Case (5% probability - if token expires):**
- ⚠️ Token exchange fails (401)
- ⚠️ Browser opens for OAuth
- ✅ User completes authentication
- ✅ App starts tracking after OAuth

**Both outcomes are acceptable** - the system is designed to handle both!
